        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>
            I work in the aviation industry, where the number of flight hours is the basic information needed to ensure the continued airworthiness of an aircraft.<br/>
            In many cases, you have to do quick calculations, adding or subtracting hours and minutes. Under time pressure, this can be quite difficult and lead to dangerous situations.<br/>
            As a result, I wrote a simple calculator to help me with this task.
